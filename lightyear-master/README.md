# Lightyear

Lightweight parser combinator library for Idris,
inspired by [Parsec](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ziman/lightyear.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ziman/lightyear)

Module overview:
* `Lightyear.Core`: central definitions + instances
* `Lightyear.Errmsg`: error message formatting, mainly internal library
* `Lightyear.Combinators`: generic combinators like `many` or `sepBy`
* `Lightyear.Char`: char-bound parsers like `char` or `space`
* `Lightyear.Strings`: string-bound parsers like `strings` or `lexeme`

## Synopsis

This package is used (almost) the same way as Parsec, except for one difference: backtracking.

### Commitment
* Parsec combinators
  won't backtrack if a branch of `<|>` has consumed any input, hence Parsec
  parsers require an explicit `try`.

* Lightyear parsers are backtrack-by-default and there is
  the `commitTo` combinator that makes the parser commit to that branch.

In other words, the following two pieces of code are equivalent (using illustrative combinator names):

Parsec:
```haskell
elem :: Parser Int
elem = (try (string "0x") >> hexNumber) <|> decNumber
```

Lightyear:
```haskell
elem : Parser Int
elem = (string "0x" $> commitTo hexNumber) <|> decNumber
-- which may be abbreviated as:
--   = (string "0x" >! hexNumber) <|> decNumber
```

After reading the prefix `0x`, both parsers commit to reading a hexadecimal number
or nothing at all â€” Parsec does this automatically, Lightyear uses the `commitTo` combinator
for this purpose.
On the other hand, Parsec requires the `string "0x"` to be wrapped in `try` because
if we are reading `0123`, we definitely don't want to commit to the left branch
upon seeing the leading `0`.

For convenience, `commitTo` is merged in monadic and applicative operators,
yielding the operators `>!=`, `>!`, `<$!>`, `<$!`, and `$!>`.
The `!` in the names is inspired by the notation used for cuts in Prolog.

A parser that uses commitment might look like this (notice the leading
`char '@'` that leads to commitment):
```haskell
entry : Parser Entry
entry = char '@' >! do
  typ <- pack <@> some (satisfy (/= '{'))
  token "{"
  ident <- pack <@> some (satisfy (/= ','))
  token ","
  items <- item `sepBy` comma
  token "}"
  return $ En typ ident items
```

### Lazy Branching with `<|>|`

It is worth noting that Idris itself is a _strict_ language, and thus the `<|>`
operator will evaluate both its arguments eagerly by default. In order to lazily
evaluate different parsing branches we are required to use a special operator:
`<|>|`. In general, all recursive calls of combinators have to occur in a lazy context.
(With mutual recursion, this generalises to the rule that each call cycle
has to be broken by laziness in at least one place.)

In the wild, it might look like this:

```idris
partial parseExpr : Parser SExpr
parseExpr = parseName <|>| ( MkSExpr <$> parens (many parseExpr) )
```

In the above example, the whole RHS of `<|>|` is lazy, and so the recursive
occurrence of `parseExpr` in it will be evaluated only if the LHS of `<|>|` fails.
Using `<|>` would cause infinite recursion.

For convenience, a version of `<*>` that lazily evaluates its second argument is
included as `<*>|`. Conversely to `<|>|`, the RHS of `<*>|` will be evaluated
only if the LHS of `<*>|` _succeeds_.

### Example

Lightyear is used to parse BibTeX in <a href="https://github.com/ziman/bibdris/blob/master/Bibtex.idr">bibdris</a>.
